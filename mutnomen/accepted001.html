    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The proposal <a href="comments001.html">SVD-WG001</a> (<span style="font-style: italic;">No
        change</span>) suggested to extend the HGVS recommendations to allow
      that when a variant screen was performed but no change detected this can
      be described using the character "=" (equal to). The Community
      Consultation closed on July 16 (2015). All comments were collected and
      discussed by the SVD-WG on Oct.6. Since no major objections were received
      the proposal was <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">accepted</span>.
      The proposal will be part of the HGVS recommendations <a href="version-list.html#v2-1511"><strong><font
            style="font-style: italic;"
            color="#FF0000">version
            2.1511</font></strong></a>. </p>
    <h3>No change</h3>
    <p>When a variant screen was performed but no change detected this should be
      described using the character "=" (equal to). The description should
      include the position(s) screened.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOTE:</span> the
      reference sequence used should always be mentioned.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples;</span></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>DNA</li>
      <ul>
        <li>c.123G=<br>
          indicates that a screen was performed to determine the identity of
          nucleotide c.123 showing it was a "G" like in the coding DNA reference
          sequence (<span style="font-style: italic;">the nucleotide was not
            changed</span>).<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOTE:</span> the
          description c.123G&gt;G is not allowed</li>
        <li>g.11890634G= indicates that a screen was performed to determine the
          identity of nucleotide g.11890634G= showing it was a "G" like in the
          genomic reference sequence (<span style="font-style: italic;">the
            nucleotide was not changed</span>).</li>
        <li>c.[123G=;456A=;789C=]&nbsp; -&nbsp; indicates that a screen was
          performed to determine the identity of nucleotides c.123, c.456 and
          c.789 (all on the same allele) showing they were all not changed
          (equal to the coding DNA reference sequence).</li>
        <li>c.[633G&gt;A];[633G=] describes a heterozygous case where one
          chromosome carries variant c.633G&gt;A and the other chromosome is not
          changed at that position (e.g. in an autosomal recessive condition)</li>
        <li>NM_001849.3(COL6A2):c.1_*1=&nbsp; -&nbsp; indicates that a screen
          was performed to determine the entire coding DNA sequence of the
          COL6A2 gene (nucleotides c.1 to c.*1 in NM_001849.3, exons only), no
          changes were detected.<br>
        </li>
        <li>LRG_476(COL6A2):g.4950_39800=&nbsp; -&nbsp; indicates that a screen
          was performed to determine the entire genomic sequence of the COL6A2
          gene (nucleotides g.4950 to g.39800 in LRG_476, exon ànd intron), no
          changes were detected.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>RNA</li>
      <ul>
        <li>r.473u=&nbsp; / c.473T=<br>
          indicates that a screen was performed to determine the identity of
          nucleotide r.473 showing it was a "u" like in the RNA reference
          sequence (<span style="font-style: italic;">the nucleotide was not
            changed</span>)</li>
        <br>
      </ul>
      <li>protein</li>
      <ul>
        <li>p.(Arg41=)&nbsp; / c.123G&gt;A<br>
          indicates the predicted consequence of the change c.123G&gt;A
          identified at DNA level (<span style="font-style: italic;">RNA not
            analysed</span>) is that the amino acid residue "Arg41" does not
          change.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOTE:</span><span
            style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
          the description p.(Arg41=) should always be given together with the
          description of the change at DNA level (depending on the amino acid,
          up to 5 different DNA changes may leave the amino acid unchanged).<br>
